bed:
  cn: 床
  tone: 2

  memo: Granted, it's upside-down (China you know) but this is clearly a couch (with a book).

book:

    Looks like two books stacked on top of each other. 
    Also a bit like a letter B, if that helps.

  memo: |
    It looks a bit like a little person standing on a chair.
    And then there's the <em>子</em> suffix for reasons that I don't fully understand.

    This is clock but also bell. 
    I can't help but notice that little hammer on the left that's going to start moving back and forth as your alarm goes off.
    It will push that little lever on the left against the thing on the right that probably has a good ring to it.

    The thing on the left which looks a bit like a <b>table</b> is the measure word for tables of guests at a venue and so on.
    The character on the right makes it one instance. Much like how <a href="/杯子10">杯子</a> is a single cup.
