bed:
  cn: 床
  py: chuáng
  set: 1
  also:
    - couch
  memo: Granted, it's upside-down (China you know) but this is clearly a couch (with a book).

clock:
  cn: 钟
  py: zhōng
  also:
    - bell
  set: 1
  memo: |
    This is clock but also bell. 
    I can't help but notice that little hammer on the left that's going to start moving back and forth as your alarm goes off.
    It will push that little lever on the left against the thing on the right that probably has a good ring to it.

book:
  cn: 书
  py: shū
  set: 1
  memo: |
    Looks like two books stacked on top of each other. 
    Also a bit like a letter B, if that helps.
