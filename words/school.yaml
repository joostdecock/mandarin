    On the left we see an adorable schoolgirl with cute little bows in her hair.
    But it's not a good day for her because she was called to the blackboard by the teacher.
    Clearly every <b>student's</b> worst nightmare.
    Also, individually, these characters are <em>study</em> and <em>pregnancy</em> so I guess that makes sense?

    Two characters.

    老 (old) is a bit too zoomed-in, but we see a bit of a wheelchair wheel here along with some 
    wheelchair frame and that brake-part of the wheelchair that you can block the wheel with. 
    Anyway, wheelchair = old

    师 (division), and if that that second line from the left is not creating a division across 
    this character, then I don't know what is.

    Not really sure why old division is teachers, but teachers are typically old and they do enjoy 
    dividing your day into boring sessions of them droning on.
