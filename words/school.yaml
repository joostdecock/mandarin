    We have the <a href="学">stufy</a> character on the left.
    On the right is person tied to a wall in some sort of torture chamber.
    And what is school if not torture.

    On the left we see an adorable schoolgirl with cute little bows in her hair.
    But it's not a good day for her because she was called to the blackboard by the teacher.
    Clearly every <b>student's</b> worst nightmare.
    Also, individually, these characters are <em>study</em> and <em>pregnancy</em> so I guess that makes sense?

    Two characters.

    老 (old) is a bit too zoomed-in, but we see a bit of a wheelchair wheel here along with some 
    wheelchair frame and that brake-part of the wheelchair that you can block the wheel with. 
    Anyway, wheelchair = old

    师 (division), and if that that second line from the left is not creating a division across 
    this character, then I don't know what is.

    Not really sure why old division is teachers, but teachers are typically old and they do enjoy 
    dividing your day into boring sessions of them droning on.
