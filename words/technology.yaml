    At the bottom is the symbol for small. And a <b>picture</b> is typically smaller then the real thing.
    At the top is what could be a camera flash.
    On the right, we see some sort of lens flare action because this is also <b>movie</b> or <b>reflection</b>

    So something electric and watching it = television
