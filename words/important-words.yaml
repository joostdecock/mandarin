    That's a smith's anvil (and hammer on the left) with a bucket of water dunked all over it. 
    That is a big NO NO. The smith will not be happy if you dunk water on his anvil.
    How it works: ① To talk about “not having” something, you negate the word 有 with 没. 
                  ② To talk about "didn't do" something, you neagte the verbs with 没.

    This is <b>not</b> the way to go, clearly.
