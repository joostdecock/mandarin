apple:
  cn: 苹果
  py: píng guǒ
  tone: 23
  set: 3
  memo: |
    The left part (ping) sounds like Tim, of Time Apple fame, and just means <b>apple</b>
    It looks a bit like one of them apple corers, so that is how you can remember it.
    The right part is fruit. It looks like a fly swatter swooping down on a counter, probably because of fruit flies.

    - fragrant

  py: xiāng jiāo
  tone: 11
  set: 3
  memo: |
    The left character is <a href="/香1">sweet smelling</a>.
    The one on the right is banana on its own too.
    It doesn't really look like a banana, more like a box of bananas with some more on the ground

bowl:
  cn: 杯
  tone: 1
  py: bēi
  set: 2
  memo: |
    I think it's helps to keep in mind this is not just <b>cup</b> but also <b>trophy cup</b>
    Because the only time you ever see those is lines up next to each other, just as these are.
    They are different shapes but that's how it typically is.
  also:
    - trophy cup
    - measure word for cups of something (like coffee)

bowl(2):
  cn: 碗
  py: wǎn
  tone: 3
  set: 4

bread:
  cn: 面包

  py: miàn bāo
  set: 2
  memo: |
    This is the character for <a href="/面">flour</a> plus the character for <a href="/包">package or bundle</a>.
    And that's essentially what <b>bread</b> is. A bundle of flour.

  cn: 饼
  py: bǐng
  tone: 3
  set: 3
  also:
    - round flat cake
    - cookie
    - pastry

  cn: 米饭
  tone: 34
  py: mǐ fàn
  set: 2
  memo: |
    On the right is the symbol for <a href="/饭">food</a>
    On the right is something that looks like the symbol for <a href="/火">fire</a>
    Since rice is the default meal in China, and fire cooks it, this is <b>cooked rice</b> (as in, the dish, not the raw material)

cup:
  cn: 杯子
  tone: 10
  py: bēi zi
  set: 2
  memo: |
    This is the <a href="/杯">trophy cup</a> character together with the <a href="/子">son</b> character.
    Makes sense that a baby trophy cup is just a <b>cup</b> or <b>glass</b>
  also:
    - glass

delicious:
  cn: 好吃
  tone: 31
  py: hǎo chī
  set: 2

  set: 4
  also:
    - pot-sticker (type of dumpling)
  memo: |
    In the character on the left, we recognize the <em>person-tied-to-a-torture-rack</em> from <a href="/学校24">学校 or school</a>.
    This time around, the left part is different. Instead of some authority figure standing on the left, there's more like a friend figure standing there.
    And we realize this person is not tied up, they are instead waving two knives around as they are having loads of fun chopping vegetables to make <b>dumplings</b>.

eat:
  cn: 吃
  tone: 1
  py: chī
  set: 1
  memo: |
    We see a person's legs here. 
    They are seated on their knees under one of them low tables, and we can see their arm reaching out, 
    chopsticks in their hand, grabbing some of that rectangular thing on the left which might be tofu perhaps? 
    In any case, they are eating.

egg:
  cn: 鸡蛋
  tone: 14
  py: jīdàn
  set: 1
  memo: |
    Two characters. 

    鸡 (chicken) has the party guy here dancing the funky chicken. 
    You can see because the right part looks a bit like an S.
    
    蛋 (egg) is a bit abstract but bear with me.
    We've got the air chamber at the top, the yoke at the bottom and then there's 
    the eggwhite sort of swimming around that and it's attached to the shell at the top. 
    The yoke is trying to break out of the shell because I guess this egg was fertilized 
    and that yoke is now a chick.

fish:
  cn: 鱼
  py: yú
  set: 3
  tone: 2
  memo: This looks like a fish in a fryer because I guess fish & chips?

flour:
  cn: 面
  tone: 4
  py: miàn 
  set: 2
  memo: |
    Looks like a little package ready to deliver that holds noodles.
    And I guess that <b>noodles</b> are the same as <b>flour</b> in Chinese, base ingredients.
    It's also used for all soft foods, and has a second meaning as face or side, surface.
    In the end, I guess we just have to remember this one.

    - noodles
    - soft (for food that isnot crunchy)
    - spineless

  py: cān
  set: 3
  tone: 1
  also:
    - to eat
    - measure word for meals
  memo: The can sound is easy enough to remember as canned food is a thing, but this charcter is very complex. Maybe it looks a bit like a can with a can opener on top? Maybe?
