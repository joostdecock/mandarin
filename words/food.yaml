dish:
  cn: 菜
  py: cài
  also:
    - type of food
  memo: This is clearly some sort of hot plate with a dish on top that seems to involve meat skewers.

eat:
  cn: 吃
  py: chī
  memo: |
    We see a person's legs here. 
    They are seated on their knees under one of them low tables, and we can see their arm reaching out, 
    chopsticks in their hand, grabbing some of that rectangular thing on the left which might be tofu perhaps? 
    In any case, they are eating.

egg:
  cn: 鸡蛋
  py: jīdàn
  memo: |
    Two characters. 

    鸡 (chicken) has the party guy here dancing the funky chicken. 
    You can see because the right part looks a bit like an S.
    
    蛋 (egg) is a bit abstract but bear with me.
    We've got the air chamber at the top, the yoke at the bottom and then there's 
    the eggwhite sort of swimming around that and it's attached to the shell at the top. 
    The yoke is trying to break out of the shell because I guess this egg was fertilized 
    and that yoke is now a chick.

fire: 
  cn: 火
  py: huǒ
  memo: Looks like  twigs/tinder and flames shooting from those twigs.

heat:
  cn: 热
  py: rè
  memo: TODO

hotpot:
  cn: 火锅
  py: Huǒguō
  memo: (*fire character* + *pot character*) = hotpot

pot:
  cn: 锅
  py: guō
  memo: | 
    Looks like a person with a ribbon in their hair standing at a table. 
    Under the table are twigs (like in the fire symbol) and there's a pot on top of the table/fire.
