alcoholic beverage:
  cn: 酒
  py: jiǔ
  set: 2
  memo: Clearly a cork on a bottle of <b>liquor</b> or another <b>alcoholic beverage</b>
  also:
    - liquor
    - spirits
    - wine (rice wine)

bowl:
  cn: 杯
  py: bēi
  set: 2
  memo: |
    I think it's helps to keep in mind this is not just <b>cup</b> but also <b>trophy cup</b>
    Because the only time you ever see those is lines up next to each other, just as these are.
    They are different shapes but that's how it typically is.
  also:
    - trophy cup

bread:
  cn: 面包
  py: miàn bāo
  set: 2
  memo: |
    This is the character for <a href="/面">flour</a> plus the character for <a href="/包">package or bundle</a>.
    And that's essentially what <b>bread</b> is. A bundle of flour.

cup:
  cn: 杯子
  py: bēi zi
  set: 2
  memo: |
    This is the <a href="/杯">trophy cup</a> character together with the <a href="/子">son</b> character.
    Makes sense that a baby trophy cup is just a <b>cup</b> or <b>glass</b>
  also:
    - glass

delicious:
  cn: 好吃
  py: hǎo chī
  set: 2
  also:
    - tasty
  memo: |
    <a href="/好">good</a> + <a href="/吃">to eat</a> = <b>delicious</b>
    You know it makes sense

    - type of food
  set: 1
  memo: This is clearly some sort of hot plate with a dish on top that seems to involve meat skewers.

eat:
  cn: 吃
  py: chī
  set: 1
  memo: |
    We see a person's legs here. 
    They are seated on their knees under one of them low tables, and we can see their arm reaching out, 
    chopsticks in their hand, grabbing some of that rectangular thing on the left which might be tofu perhaps? 
    In any case, they are eating.

egg:
  cn: 鸡蛋
  py: jīdàn
  set: 1
  memo: |
    Two characters. 

    鸡 (chicken) has the party guy here dancing the funky chicken. 
    You can see because the right part looks a bit like an S.
    
    蛋 (egg) is a bit abstract but bear with me.
    We've got the air chamber at the top, the yoke at the bottom and then there's 
    the eggwhite sort of swimming around that and it's attached to the shell at the top. 
    The yoke is trying to break out of the shell because I guess this egg was fertilized 
    and that yoke is now a chick.

fire: 
  cn: 火
  py: huǒ
  set: 1
  memo: Looks like  twigs/tinder and flames shooting from those twigs.

flour:
  cn: 面
  py: miàn 
  set: 2
  memo: |
    Looks like a little package ready to deliver that holds noodles.
    And I guess that <b>noodles</b> are the same as <b>flour</b> in Chinese, base ingredients.
    It's also used for all soft foods, and has a second meaning as face or side, surface.
    In the end, I guess we just have to remember this one.
  also:
    - noodles
    - soft (for food that isnot crunchy)
    - spineless
    - face
    - side
    - surface
    - top

    - cooked rice
    - meal
  memo: |
    On the right it looks like one of those things to rest chop sticks on.
    On the left is something half-eaten.
    In the middle is a drinking straw perhaps.
    Let's just say it's <b>food</b>

heat:
  cn: 热
  py: rè
  set: 1
  memo: We see a grill here with a couple of meat skewers on it. So <b>heat</b>.

hotpot:
  cn: 火锅
  py: huǒguō

  memo: <a href="/火">fire character</a> plus <a href="/锅">pot character</a> = <b>hotpot</b>

pot:
  cn: 锅
  py: guō
  set: 1
  memo: | 
    Looks like a person with a ribbon in their hair standing at a table.

red wine: 
  cn: 红葡萄酒
  py: hóng pú tao jiǔ

    Character for <a href="/红">red</a>

  cn: 饭馆
  py: fàn guǎn

roast duck:
  cn: 烤鸭
  py: kǎo yā
  set: 2
  memo: |
    On the left we have a squished fire + old symbol. And an old fire (embers) is where you <b>roast</b> things on.
    On the right we have the character for <a href="/鸭">duck</a>
