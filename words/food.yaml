    We see a person's legs here. 
    They are seated on their knees under one of them low tables, and we can see their arm reaching out, 
    chopsticks in their hand, grabbing some of that rectangular thing on the left which might be tofu perhaps? 
    In any case, they are eating.

    Two characters. 

    鸡 (chicken) has the party guy here dancing the funky chicken. 
    You can see because the right part looks a bit like an S.
    
    蛋 (egg) is a bit abstract but bear with me.
    We've got the air chamber at the top, the yoke at the bottom and then there's 
    the eggwhite sort of swimming around that and it's attached to the shell at the top. 
    The yoke is trying to break out of the shell because I guess this egg was fertilized 
    and that yoke is now a chick.

    On the right it looks like one of those things to rest chop sticks on.
    On the left is something half-eaten.
    In the middle is a drinking straw perhaps.
