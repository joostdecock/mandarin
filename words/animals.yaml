    You know how Panda's are endangered and everybody is always looking at them because they are cute?
    Well, on the left you have the symbol for bear.
    <small>(notice the 4 claws at the left, it's essentially a footprint)</small>
    On the right, we have a cage with lights above, and some tourist looking at it.
    <small>(You can see it's a tourist because they are wearing a sombrero hat)</small>

    You know how sheep look massive, but they're really not that big because it's all that wool?
    Well, this symbols captures that. You have the vertical line in the middle which is the sheep.
    And those horizontal lines are all the wool. Which is why there's no line at the bottom because the wool doesn't grow on the legs.
    Also, those are the eyes at the top. Obviously.
