    One the right is some dude holding a chair over his head, 
    the left person is swinging what I assume is their necktie around. 
    Obviously this is a pretty wild party, and there's a lot of joy here.

    We've got a little bench, in front of a small table, with a bowl of food on it.
    There's one of them ceiling fans overhead to provide a cool breeze while enjoying this lovely meal.
    Obviously, this is a happy moment, so happiness.
