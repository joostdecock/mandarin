    名 (name) is a person with a cute hairstyle wearing a commically oversized name tag to put their name on.
    字 (character/word), in Chinese we try to cram as much as possible in a single character/word.
    Here you see a character being made, with the press to cram all that info in shown at the top.

    This is pretty meta, but it's saying <em>this is the name character</em>, in other words: the name of.
