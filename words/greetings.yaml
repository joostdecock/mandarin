name (of someone/thing):

  memo: |
    Two characters.
    
    名 (name) is a person with a cute hairstyle wearing a commically oversized name tag to put their name on.
    字 (character/word), in Chinese we try to cram as much as possible in a single character/word.
    Here you see a character being made, with the press to cram all that info in shown at the top.

    This is pretty meta, but it's saying *this is the name character*, in other words: the name of.

nevermind: 
  cn: 没关系
  py: méiguānxì
  memo: | 
    Three characters. 
  
    没 (no), you know this one
    关 (close) is the fire symbol with two lids on top of it to **close** the fire (as in, put it out)
    系 (tie (verb)); somebody is tied down on a bed here. 
    It's not my thing, but hey, don't kink-shame. To each their own.

    So no-close-tie means, no need to tie this up all neatly, nevermind.

  cn: 人
  py: rén

sorry:

    对 (right), see that little piece falling down?
    That's because this character dislocated its shoulder from padding itself on the back for being so right. 
    Party guy is also waving his tie around to celebrate.

    不 (not). You know this one
    起 (rise) shows a radiator and cold air getting sucked in and then rising as it warms up. 
    Not sure what the upside-down 2 is about.

    Saying - *You are right, do not rise your temper, I'm sorry*.

  cn: 别客气
  py: bié kèqì
  memo: | 
    Three characters here; 
    别 (do not) is a guy facing not one but two walls. Clearly do not.
    客 (guest) is a bed with under a roof with some fancy drapes over it. Clearly a hotel, so guest.
    气 (gas/energy) or how else do you draw a fart?
    Guest and energy together mean polite. 
    Do not polite or do not guest energy is saying, No need to be so polite, you're welcome!*
