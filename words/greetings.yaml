    <a href="/请">to ask</a> + another <a href="/问">to ask</a> means <b>excuse me, may I ask ... ?</b> which makes sense since you're asking whether you can ask somehting so two asks.

    So here we have a guy on the right who is high-fiving their own reflection in the mirror on the left.

    Two characters.
    
    名 (name) is a person with a cute hairstyle wearing a commically oversized name tag to put their name on.
    字 (character/word), in Chinese we try to cram as much as possible in a single character/word.
    Here you see a character being made, with the press to cram all that info in shown at the top.

    This is pretty meta, but it's saying <em>this is the name character</em>, in other words: the name of.

    Three characters. 
  
    没 (no), you know this one
    关 (close) is the fire symbol with two lids on top of it to <b>close</b> the fire (as in, put it out)
    系 (tie (verb)); somebody is tied down on a bed here. 
    It's not my thing, but hey, don't kink-shame. To each their own.

    So no-close-tie means, no need to tie this up all neatly, nevermind.

    You know the left from <a href="/可乐">cola</a>.
    The rigth means ability, and together they form <b>perhaps, possible, probable, maybe</b> and so on.

    - probable
    - possibility
    - probability

    Three characters here. 

    对 (right), see that little piece falling down?
    That's because this character dislocated its shoulder from padding itself on the back for being so right. 
    Party guy is also waving his tie around to celebrate.

    不 (not). You know this one
    起 (rise) shows a radiator and cold air getting sucked in and then rising as it warms up. 
    Not sure what the upside-down 2 is about.

    Saying - <em>You are right, do not rise your temper, I'm sorry</em>.

    You see two people standing at the water cooler. The person on the left nods there head to say <b>thanks</b>.
    Note that one of these symbols is <em>thank-you</em> as an adjective (like a thank-you card).
    Together they are proper <b>thanks</b>.

    If you squint your eyes, you can see yourself on the shower here.
    You should check your ego, because it's good to be humble.
    That's what there's a <a href="/小">small</a> character inside <b>you</b>.

you (formal):
  cn: 您

  py: nín
  notes: Typically used when addressing old people.

  memo: |
    If you remember the character for <a href="/你">you</a> it's essentially a small you under the shower.
    This is the more formal version, typically reserved for the elderly.
    That's why there's a little stool in the shower, because they are so short.
    Also, do you know how many senior citizens slip in the shower and break their hip? That's why we have that stool there.

you're welcome: 
  cn: 别客气

  memo: | 
    Three characters here; 
    别 (do not) is a guy facing not one but two walls. Clearly do not.
    客 (guest) is a bed with under a roof with some fancy drapes over it. Clearly a hotel, so guest.
    气 (gas/energy) or how else do you draw a fart?
    Guest and energy together mean polite. 
    Do not polite or do not guest energy is saying, No need to be so polite, you're welcome!
