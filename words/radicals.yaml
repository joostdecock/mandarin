legs:
  r: 10
  cn: 儿
  py: ér

  cn: 入
  py: rù
  tone: 4
  set: 4
  memo: Looks like spread legs, which is a rather inviting pose

eight:
  r: 12
  cn: 八
  py: bā
  tone: 1
  set: 4
  memo: Depending on the font, this either looks like cleavage, or crossed legs. Neither means '8' but an eight on its side looks a bit like boobs, so there's that

knife:
  r: 18
  cn: 刀
  py: dāo
  tone: 1
  set: 4
  memo: Not really seeing this as a knife. More like an italic pi character, and italian pie is pizza, which requires a knife to cut

power:
  r: 19
  cn: 力
  py: lì
  tone: 4
  set: 4
  memo: Looks a bit like the knife radical, but the vertical stroke crosses through the line because it's so powerful

  cn: 勹
  py: bāo
  tone: 1
  set: 4

  cn: 匸
  py: xǐ
  tone: 3
  set: 4

  r: 24
  cn: 十
  py: shí
  tone: 2

  py: jié
  tone: 2

enclosure:
  r: 31
  cn: 囗
  py: wéi
  tone: 2 
  set: 4
  memo: That is not a mouth, that is an enclosure. It's clearly bigger.

earth:
  r: 32
  cn: 土
  py: tǔ
  tone: 3
  set: 4
  memo: They could not use a horizontal line, that was already taken. So the thing you plant a cross in.

scholar:
  r: 33
  cn: 士
  py: 士
  tone: 4 
  set: 4
  memo: This looks a lot like earth, but it has its horizontal lines inverted. Focussing less on the base (or basics) and more on higher lines (of thought), like a scholar would

  cn: 夂
  py: zhī
  tone: 1
  set: 4

go slowly:
  r: 35
  cn: 夊
  py: suī
  tone: 1
  set: 4

  set: 4
  memo: We see the same horizontal stroke as in woman, but we don't see anything clearly identifying the gender as this is still a child.

roof:

  cn: 宀
  py: mián
  tone: 2
  set: 4
  memo: Easy enough, it's a rood. The trick is to not confuse this with lid

inch:
  r: 41
  cn: 寸
  py: cùn
  tone: 4
  set: 4
  memo: Seriously? Inch!? Inch is a radical? I guess so. It's almost like a 10, with an extra stroke to make it clear that it's nothing like a 10 because imperial measurements make no sense whatsoever.

small:
  r: 42
  cn: 小
  py: xiǎo
  tone: 3
  set: 4

lame:
  r: 3
  cn: 尢
  py: yóu
  tone: 2
  set: 4
