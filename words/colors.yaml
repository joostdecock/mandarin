    I am a big fan of black, and I'm also a big fan of this character.
    Look at it. It's got heat (it's hot) but it's also got the most adorable face.
    It's like it's instantly captures my heart, much like <b>black</b> does.
    It's also the loan word for <b>hack</b> so really I feel this character is the best.

    Do not confuse this with the upside-down 'ba'. This is **color**.
    It's also look/appearance/sex so obviously not 爸爸 related.
    Maybe you can see a pair for (very) funky sunglasses in this?

    That's the work character on the right, and a bunch of layers being cut through on the left.
    I guess if you're a surgeon cutting things is work. And when you do, they bleed <b>red</b>.
    Being a <b>revolutionary</b> surgeon also makes you <b>popular</b> so that's a <b>bonus</b>.
