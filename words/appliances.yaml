    冰 means ice and 箱 means box. So pretty obvious if you know those two. 
    Ice is essentially the symbol for water but all cracked up because it's now frozen. 
    Box is a bit more elaborate but it's essentially hanging from a bar that's used to carry it around. 
    There's also other stuff hanging from that bar. Don't overthink it.
