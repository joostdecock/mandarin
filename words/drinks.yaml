    This is <em>a lot</em> to just say coffee. 
    Which goes to show tea is the more popular drink in China. 
    Still let us try.

    On the left we clearly have a large coffee with a drinking straw with the barista on the left and the customer on the right. 
    How do you know it's not a lemonade in the cup? 
    Well on the right we see a person working a device which one must assume is what they use to ground those coffee beans.

cola:

    So this is clearly an imported thing, because what we see here on the left is some american dude
    (notice the large squarish head) in his car at the McDonalds drive-tru ordering a large cola.
    You can see the drive-thru roof on the right, as well as the bendy-straw that goes in the cola.
    I mean sure, the bendy straw is upside down. 
    But don't forget that China is on the other side of the world, so it kinda makes sense that way?

    There's a wall on the left, and then a liquor cabinet and a table. 
    We see a figure slumped under the table who is sitting on his behind because 
    they are too drunk to stand up from all the drinking they did.

tea:

    I mean look at it.
    It's clearly some adorable little tea-shop with one of them Chinese curved rooftops and little lanterns hanging over it.
    There's a little table with a bench on each side that slid back on your end of the table in a welcoming way.
    Obviously you'd want to have some <b>tea</b> in this adorable little place.

water:

    This a combination of watery things. 
    In the middle is the bendy straw, also featured in 可乐.
    On the left, that's clearly the tip of a boat.
    And on the right, those are waves crashing against that wall that the boat is also tethered to somehow. 

    What I'm saying is - What binds the all together is that they all have to do with <b>water</b>.
