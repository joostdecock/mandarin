    Zero is weird, and so is this character. 
    We've got a table with a bench that for some weird reason sits on top of a 
    small house that has a PI symbol in it, which is a handy reminder that this
    is about mathematics. Still, it makes <b>zero</b> sense.

1: 
  cn: 一
  tone: 1
  py: yī
  set: 1
  memo: Like the roman numeral, but on its side. I hope you can remember at least this one.

2: 
  cn: 二
  tone: 4
  py: èr
  set: 1
  memo: Like the roman numeral, but on its side. Also - like one, but twice, because 1 + 1 = 2

3: 
  cn: 三
  tone: 1
  py: sān
  set: 1
  memo: Like the roman numeral, but on it's side. Three layers, like and Oreo cookie.

4:
  cn: 四
  tone: 4
  py: sì
  set: 1
  memo: This is a PI symbol in a room stuck to the ceiling. And if you <code>ceil(PI)</code> you get four, that's a fact.

5:
  cn: 五
  tone: 3
  py: wǔ
  set: 1
  memo: |
    If you squint, there's a 5 in there. Just ignore the left part. 
    Also, this is the three character with two extra lines, so five.

6: 
  cn: 六
  tone: 4
  py: liù
  set: 1
  memo: I don't want to be <em>that guy</em> but six sounds like sex and if this is not a person spread eagle to get railed, I don't know what is.

7: 
  cn: 七
  tone: 1
  py: qī
  set: 1
  memo: This is just an upside-down 7. Which makes sense since it's in China so it would be upside-down.

8: 
  cn: 八
  tone: 1
  py: bā
  set: 1
  memo: |
    You know how an 8 on its side looks like boobs? 
    If this is not cleavage we're looking at here, then I guess I'm weird. 
    But that's how I remember it.

9: 
  cn: 九
  tone: 3
  py: jiǔ
  set: 1
  memo: |
    I find this one hard to explain, but my trick is that there's a bit of a J shape in there. 
    So maybe that means that in China I could be a 9?

10:
  cn: 十
  tone: 2
  py: shí
  set: 1
  memo: |
    Not sure why it's a plus symbol. 
    But it makes sense that for 10 you'd want something strong and symetric. 
    Something confident that says <em>I'm a ten</em> so I guess this is it.

100:
  cn: 百
  tone: 3
  py: bǎi
  set: 1
  memo: |
    At one point you're going to have so much that you need to put that in a little box 
    with a carrying handle. That box holds 100 of whatever.

1000:
  cn: 千
  tone: 1
  py: qiān
  set: 1
  memo: |
    I don't know exactly why that one extra line to the symbol for 10
    raises it to the third power, but I don't make the rules.
