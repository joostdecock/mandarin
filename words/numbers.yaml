    Zero is weird, and so is this character. 
    We've got a table with a bench that for some weird reason sits on top of a 
    small house that has a PI symbol in it, which is a handy reminder that this
    is about mathematics. Still, it makes <b>zero</b> sense.

1: 
  cn: 一
  tone: 1
  py: yī
  set: 1
  memo: Like the roman numeral, but on its side. I hope you can remember at least this one.

2: 
  cn: 二
  tone: 4
  py: èr
  set: 1
  memo: Like the roman numeral, but on its side. Also - like one, but twice, because 1 + 1 = 2

3: 
  cn: 三
  tone: 1
  py: sān
  set: 1
  memo: Like the roman numeral, but on it's side. Three layers, like and Oreo cookie.

4:
  cn: 四
  tone: 4
  py: sì
  set: 1
  memo: This is a PI symbol in a room stuck to the ceiling. And if you <code>ceil(PI)</code> you get four, that's a fact.

5:
  cn: 五
  tone: 3
  py: wǔ
  set: 1
  memo: |
    If you squint, there's a 5 in there. Just ignore the left part. 
    Also, this is the three character with two extra lines, so five.

6: 
  cn: 六
  tone: 4
  py: liù
  set: 1
  memo: I don't want to be <em>that guy</em> but six sounds like sex and if this is not a person spread eagle to get railed, I don't know what is.

7: 
  cn: 七
  tone: 1
  py: qī
  set: 1
  memo: This is just an upside-down 7. Which makes sense since it's in China so it would be upside-down.

8: 
  cn: 八
  tone: 1
  py: bā
  set: 1
  memo: |
    You know how an 8 on its side looks like boobs? 
    If this is not cleavage we're looking at here, then I guess I'm weird. 
    But that's how I remember it.

9: 
  cn: 九
  tone: 3
  py: jiǔ
  set: 1
  memo: |
    I find this one hard to explain, but my trick is that there's a bit of a J shape in there. 
    So maybe that means that in China I could be a 9?

10:
  cn: 十
  tone: 2
  py: shí
  set: 1
  memo: |
    Not sure why it's a plus symbol. 
    But it makes sense that for 10 you'd want something strong and symetric. 
    Something confident that says <em>I'm a ten</em> so I guess this is it.

100:
  cn: 百
  tone: 3
  py: bǎi
  set: 1
  memo: |
    At one point you're going to have so much that you need to put that in a little box 
    with a carrying handle. That box holds 100 of whatever.

1000:
  cn: 千
  tone: 1
  py: qiān
  set: 1
  memo: |
    I don't know exactly why that one extra line to the symbol for 10
    raises it to the third power, but I don't make the rules. 

chunk:
  cn: 块
  tone: 4
  py: kuài
  set: 2
  also:
    - lump (of earth)
    - piece
    - measure word for pieces of cloth, caje soap
    - measure word for money
  memo:
    - You can sort of thing as the left part being the corner <b>chunk</b> that was broken of of the right part

day of a month:
  cn: 号
  tone: 4
  py: hào
  set: 2
  also:
    - ordinal number
    - mark
    - sign
    - size
    - classifier to indicate number of people
    - roar
    - cry
  memo: |
    This looks a bit like those displays at the cash register showing you the <b>number</b> or price.
    You can also see the paper for the receipt feeding through the printer at the bottom.

two:
  cn: 梁
  tone: 2
  py: liáng
  set: 1
  memo: |
    This looks like a bunch of people dancing on a table.
    Which sometimes happens at a wedding, which is the union between <b>two</b> people.
    Yes, I know poly-weddings are possible, but I'm just trying to remember stuff here. 

many:
  cn: 多
  tone: 1
  py: duō
  set: 2
  also: 
    - much
    - often
    - a lot of
    - numerous
    - more
    - in excess
    - how (to what extent)
  memo: |
    Sounds like duo, which is what we see here.
    Also the general quantity vibes matches well with the repetition on display.

money:
  cn: 钱
  tone: 2
  py: qián
  set: 2
  also:
    - coin
  memo: Person window shopping, thingking about how much <b>money</b> to spend

two (only for two exists such a thing):
  cn: 两
  tone: 3
  py: liǎng
  set: 2
  also:
    - both
    - some
    - a few
  memo: There's two in this package

very (adverb of degree):
  cn: 很
  tone: 3
  py: hěn
  set: 2
  also:
    - quite
    - awfully
  memo: 
    The right part of this looks like one of them golf flags.
    So it makes sense that this also means awfully because people who play golf are typically <b>very</b> awful people.
