    First of all, this looks like a scale so that's a good fit for a measure word.
    It's also origin/source and you can sort of see it as something welling up from under the surface.
    Finally, there's also a bit of book shape in there. 
    Does that help?

  memo: |
    On the left we've got what looks to be side side of a Xmas tree.
    On the right we've got a crib and either a roof over it or more trees.
    This is, weirdly enough, some sort of nativity scene.
    So I think the reasoning here is that the person in this crib came <b>to</b> earth to die <b>for</b> our sins.
    Or at least <b>to give</b> and <b>to allow</b> us to do better <b>for the benenit of</b> all of us.
    I'm not saying I believe it, but that's what I see.
