age:
  cn: 年龄
  py: nián líng
  set: 1
  memo: |
    This is the symbol for year plus another symbol that looks to be a bunch of picture frames.
    So year-pictures means <b>age</b>. At least that's how I remember it.

a period of time:
  cn: 期
  py: qī
  set: 2
  also:
    - phase
    - stage
    - time
    - period
    - to hope
  memo: |
    A month symbol on the right which looks like a calendar.
    On the left, more calendar with a box drawn around <b>a period of time</b>

current:
  cn: 今
  py: jīn
  set: 2
  also:
    - today
    - modern
    - present
    - now
    - this

day:
  cn: 天
  py: tiān
  set: 2
  also:
    - sky
    - heaven
  memo: |
    Looks a bit like a tower pointing to the <b>sky</b> or <b>heaven</b>
    Perhaps one <b>day</b> you'll get to the top of that tower.

how big:
  cn: 多大
  py: duōdà
  set: 2
  also:
    - How old are you (for children only)
  memo: You know the character for big, and the first one is <a href="/多">many/much/often/how</a>

month:
  cn: 月
  py: yuè
  set: 2
  also:
    - moon
    - monthly
  memo: This is clearly a calendar page showing one <b>month</b>

morning:
  cn: 上午
  py: shàngwǔ
  set: 1
  memo: |
    These are simple characters because we're not fully awake yet.
    On the left, we see a bed. On the right one of those french press cofee makers.
    Clearly, this is <b>morning</b>.

next:
  cn: 明
  py: míng 
  set: 2
  also:
    - bright
    - clear (in meaning)
    - to understand
    - public or open
    - wise

this year:
  cn: 今年
  py: jīnnián
  set: 1
  memo: |
    On the left, we see an upside down agenda/calendar on a table.
    On the right, somebody is pinned to a bed because they went out late last night.
    Sounds like it was new year's even, and <b>this year</b> is of to a rough start.

today:
  cn: 今天
  py: jīn tiān
  set: 2
  memo: |
    Symbol for <a href="/今">current</a> plus symbol for <a href="/天">day</a> = <b>today</b>

week:
  cn: 星期
  py: xīngqí
  set: 2
  also:
    - day of the week
    - sunday
  memo: |
    <a href="/星">star</a> + <a href="/期">a perdiod of time</a> = <b>week</b>
    Which makes sense because these days, celebrities/stars become famous and then cancelled in the span of about a week.

  also:
    - circle
    - to circle
    - circumference
    - lap
    - cycle
    - complete
    - all
    - all over
    - thorough
    - to help financially
  memo: |
    This is an alternative form of week where the meaning is crammed in a single character.
    Essentially, this symbol means <b>cycle</b> (among other things) so it makes sense to also use it for week.
    If you squint, this looks like a completed check box. As this also means <b>complete</b> that could help.

year:
  cn: 年
  py: nián
  set: 1
  memo: |
    I try to remember this as a big push pin that goes through a book.
    Why? Because the new year is always a big event in a calendar (book).
    I'm not saying it makes sense. It's just the best I have.

years:
  cn: 岁
  py: suì
  set: 1
  also:
    - years old
    - measure word for years
  memo: |

    At the top, there's candles like you put on a birthday cake it indicate the <b>years</b>.

yesterday:
  cn: 昨天
  py: zuótiān
  set: 2
  memo: |
    On the right we have <a href="/天">day</a> which is a nice reminder this has something to do with days.
    The left thing makes it <b>yesterday</b>. It looks a bit like it's waving goodbye and moving to the left with those drag lines.
