    This is the <a href="/女">women</a> character plus the <a href="/儿">son</a> character.
    That a <b>daughter</b> is essentially a <em>women son</em> is a kinda sad but I don't make the rules.

family:
  cn: 家
  py: jiā
  set: 1
  also:
    - home
  memo: |
    A big and a small person are shielding under the same umbrella.
    Since it's a grown-up and a child, this is not a couple.
    This is a parent and child, in other words a <b>family</b>.

friend:
  cn: 朋友
  py: péngyǒu
  set: 1
  memo: |
    Two people (on the left) and when one is down, the other is shielding them (on the right).
    Clearly these are what is looks like to have a <b>friend</b>

grandfather:
  cn: 爷爷
  py: yéye
  set: 1
  memo: |
    These double identical characters are common in family names because they are designed for babies. 
    Things like mama and papa are easy to say. And so is yéyé.
    You can see it's a male because the two hammers at the top mean manly business.
    You can tell it's the grandfather because the entire things sits on a pedestal, and you know how respect for the elderly is a thing in China.

grandmother:
  cn: 奶奶
  py: nǎinai
  set: 1
  memo: | 
    The character from *good* on the left, but now ATM on the right (as for mama) but 
    rather a counter of a bank because back in grandma's days, there were no ATMs.

individual:
  cn: 个
  py: gè
  set: 1
  memo: General classifier for an individual. Just one person with a hat on.

mama: 
  cn: 妈妈
  py: māma
  set: 1
  memo: | 
    The left part of this sign is also used in the symbol for *good*.
    The right looks like an ATM machine. 
    Because you know mama is your best ATM. 

papa:
  cn: 爸爸
  py: bàba
  set: 1
  memo: | 
     First up, this is the same symbol twice. 
     Each has 2 hammers and an iron that's upside-down. 
     It's upside-down becase ironing is mama's job. 
     Fixing the iron with a hammer though, totally papa's job.

son:
  cn: 儿
  py: ér
  set: 1
  memo: |
    Standing with your legs apart is such a male thing to do. Essentially menspreading.
    This is <b>son</b> which you can tell by the skinny legs. Not fully grown yet.

woman:
  cn: 女
  py: nǚ
  set: 1
  also:
    - the female sex
  memo: With those long legs and narrow waist, this is clearly a <b>woman</b>
