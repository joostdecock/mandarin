brother:
  cn: 兄弟
  tone: 14
  py: xiōngdì
  set: 2
  memo: |
    This is <a href="/兄">older brother</a> + <a href="/弟">younger brother</a>
    So just <b>brother</b> as the age indicators cancel each other out.

daughter:
  cn: 女儿
  tone: 32
  py: nǚ'ér
  set: 1
  memo: |
    This is the <a href="/女">women</a> character plus the <a href="/儿">son</a> character.
    That a <b>daughter</b> is essentially a <em>women son</em> is a kinda sad but I don't make the rules.

dad and mom:
  cn: 爸妈
  py: bà mā
  tone: 41
  set: 3
  memo: This is just short for 爸爸 & 妈妈

friend:
  cn: 朋友
  tone: 23
  py: péngyǒu
  set: 1
  memo: |
    Two people (on the left) and when one is down, the other is shielding them (on the right).
    Clearly these are what is looks like to have a <b>friend</b>

grandfather:
  cn: 爷爷
  tone: 20
  py: yéye
  set: 1
  memo: |
    These double identical characters are common in family names because they are designed for babies. 
    Things like mama and papa are easy to say. And so is yéyé.
    You can see it's a male because the two hammers at the top mean manly business.
    You can tell it's the grandfather because the entire things sits on a pedestal, and you know how respect for the elderly is a thing in China.

grandmother:
  cn: 奶奶
  tone: 30
  py: nǎinai
  set: 1
  memo: | 
    The character from <em>good</em> on the left, but now ATM on the right (as for mama) but 
    rather a counter of a bank because back in grandma's days, there were no ATMs.

home:
  cn: 家
  tone: 1
  py: jiā
  set: 1
  also:
    - family
  memo: |
    A big and a small person are shielding under the same roof.
    Since it's a grown-up and a child, this is not a couple.
    This is a parent and child, in other words a <b>family</b> in their <b>home</b>.

individual:
  cn: 个
  tone: 4
  py: gè
  set: 1
  memo: General classifier for an individual. Just one person with a hat on.

mama: 
  cn: 妈妈
  tone: 10
  py: māma
  set: 1
  memo: | 
    The left part of this sign is also used in the symbol for <em>good</em>.
    The right looks like an ATM machine. 
    Because you know mama is your best ATM. 

older brother:
  cn: 兄
  tone: 1
  py: xiōng
  set: 2
  memo: |
    This is the symbol for <a href="/儿">son</a> carrying a big box.
    So clearly this is the older brother. That box is heavy after all.

papa:
  cn: 爸爸
  tone: 40
  py: bàba
  set: 1
  memo: | 
     First up, this is the same symbol twice. 
     Each has 2 hammers and an iron that's upside-down. 
     It's upside-down becase ironing is mama's job. 
     Fixing the iron with a hammer though, totally papa's job.

son (base character):
  cn: 儿
  tone: 2
  py: ér
  set: 2
  memo: Standing with your legs apart is such a male thing to do. Essentially menspreading.

son:
  cn: 儿子
  tone: 20
  py: érzi
  set: 1
  memo: |
    On the left, standing with your legs apart is such a male thing to do. Essentially menspreading.
    This is <a href="/儿">son</a> which you can tell by the skinny legs. Not fully grown yet.
    On the right, this character means <em>small thing</em> so that is that.

together:
  cn: 一起
  py: yī qǐ
  tone: 13
  set: 3
  also:
    - in the same palce
    - with
    - altogether (in total)
  memo: fixme

wife:
  cn: 老婆
  py: lǎopó
  tone: 32
  set: 2
  memo: |
    That character on the left meand old, as in teacher.
    The character on the right has the female sign at the bottom and then it seems to be yelling at the top, so I guess this is the ol' <b>wife</b> yelling at her husband.

younger brother:
  cn: 弟 
  tone: 4
  py: dì
  set: 2
  also:
    - junior male
  memo: |
    Look at him, walking around with arms and legs sort of all over the place.
    It's the typical thing when the body has a growth spurt but they muscles are legging behind and so they are sort of having trouble controlling their own body.
    Obviously, <b>younger brother</b>
