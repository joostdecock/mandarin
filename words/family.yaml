    The character from *good* on the left, but now ATM on the right (as for mama) but 
    rather a counter of a bank because back in grandma's days, there were no ATMs.

    The left part of this sign is also used in the symbol for *good*.
    The right looks like an ATM machine. 
    Because you know mama is your best ATM.

     First up, this is the same symbol twice. 
     Each has 2 hammers and an iron that's upside-down. 
     It's upside-down becase ironing is mama's job. 
     Fixing the iron with a hammer though, totally papa's job.
