Belgium:

    Three characters here; 

    比 (compare) is the perfect symbol, since they are almost but not really the same, you can't help but compare.
    利 (profit) since line must go up, and this arrow clearly points the way.
    時 (time) seems to be one of them modern church buildings (based on the cross on top), 
    but what they all have is a big ass clock. Coz time.

    Ok so compare-profit-time does not make much sense, but it's just because Bĭ-lì-shí sounds like Be-lgi-um. 
    Or it would if you were used to speaking Chinese.

China:

    That flag symbol on the left means like, in the middle.
    The symbol on the right is country.
    So this is <em>the country in the middle</em> which makes sense because everybody looks at the world by placing themselves in the middle.

USA:
  cn: 美国
  py: měi guó

    Two characters.
    美 (nice) looks kinda nice with those lines nicely aligned.

    国 (country) is the mouth character with the 3 character inside (and one flow).
    Because most countries have three branches of government; judicial, legislative, and executive

    Don't ask me why USA is *nice country*. I assume its sarcasm.
