    The character for <a href="/屁">fart</a> plus the character for <a href="/股">part</a> (so butt-part) make <b>fart</b>.
    Here's why Chinese is the greatest language ever. 

fart:
  cn: 屁
  py: pì
  set: 2
  memo: This <b>fart</b> (also <b>nonsense</b>) hangs like a cloud over those two poor noses.
  also:
    - nonsense

foot:
  cn: 足
  py: zú

    Those are toes and the outline of a sandal I guess. 
    The big toe is much larger, which makes it hit close to home for me and my big feet.

hand:
  cn: 手
  py: shǒu
  set: 1
  memo: |
    I guess this looks a bit like the way a small child would draw a hand? 
    Personally, I find it looks more like a cross-section of a cuff link, which is also close to the hand.

heart:
  cn: 心
  py: xīn 
  set: 2
  also:
    - center
    - core
  memo: |
    I guess if you're really bad at drawing a heart, and then it falls over so that it's somewhat broken and upside down?
    Also, mirrored J shape which for me looks like I'm looking inwards, into my <b>heart</b>.

  memo: |
    Not certain whether this is a car grill, a fly swatter, or one a hose running out of a basement window to pump it dry.
    But what I do know is that all of those describe things <b>male</b> people are concerned with.

mouth:
  cn: 口
  py: kǒu
  set: 1
  memo: Look at that mouth (of our robot overlord). 

part:
  cn: 股
  py: gǔ
  set: 2
  memo: |
    We've got no on the right and then something that looks like a squished month opn the left.
    So I guess we can remember that no, it's not month. It's only a <b>part</b> of it.
