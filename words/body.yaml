    Those are toes and the outline of a sandal I guess. 
    The big toe is much larger, which makes it hit close to home for me and my big feet.

    I guess this looks a bit like the way a small child would draw a hand? 
    Personally, I find it looks more like a cross-section of a cuff link, which is also close to the hand.

heart:

    I guess if you're really bad at drawing a heart, and then it falls over so that it's somewhat broken and upside down?
    Also, mirrored J shape which for me looks like I'm looking inwards, into my <b>heart</b>.

mouth:

  memo: Look at that mouth (of our robot overlord).
